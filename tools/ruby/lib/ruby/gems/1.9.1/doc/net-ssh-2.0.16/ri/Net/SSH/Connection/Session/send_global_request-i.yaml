- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Send a global request of the given type. The <tt>extra</tt> parameters must be even in number, and conform to the same format as described for Net::SSH::Buffer.from. If a callback is not specified, the request will not require a response from the server, otherwise the server is required to respond and indicate whether the request was successful or not. This success or failure is indicated by the callback being invoked, with the first parameter being true or false (success, or failure), and the second being the packet itself.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Generally, Net::SSH will manage global requests that need to be sent (e.g. port forward requests and such are handled in the Net::SSH::Service::Forward class, for instance). However, there may be times when you need to send a global request that isn't explicitly handled by Net::SSH, and so this method is available to you.
