  :body: Basically the same as the Strict verifier, but does not try to actually verify a connection if the server is the localhost and the port is a nonstandard port number. Those two conditions will typically mean the connection is being tunnelled through a forwarded port, so the known-hosts file will not be helpful (in general).
