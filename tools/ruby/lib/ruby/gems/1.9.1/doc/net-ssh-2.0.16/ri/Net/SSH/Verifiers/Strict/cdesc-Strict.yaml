  :body: Does a strict host verification, looking the server up in the known host files to see if a key has already been seen for this server. If this server does not appear in any host file, this will silently add the server. If the server does appear at least once, but the key given does not match any known for the server, an exception will be raised (HostKeyMismatch). Otherwise, this returns true.
