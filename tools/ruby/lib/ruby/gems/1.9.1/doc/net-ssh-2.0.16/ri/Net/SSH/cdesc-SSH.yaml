  :body: Net::SSH is a library for interacting, programmatically, with remote processes via the SSH2 protocol. Sessions are always initiated via Net::SSH.start. From there, a program interacts with the new SSH session via the convenience methods on Net::SSH::Connection::Session, by opening and interacting with new channels (Net::SSH::Connection:Session#open_channel and Net::SSH::Connection::Channel), or by forwarding local and/or remote ports through the connection (Net::SSH::Service::Forward).
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: The SSH protocol is very event-oriented. Requests are sent from the client to the server, and are answered asynchronously. This gives great flexibility (since clients can have multiple requests pending at a time), but it also adds complexity. Net::SSH tries to manage this complexity by providing some simpler methods of synchronous communication (see Net::SSH::Connection::Session#exec!).
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: In general, though, and if you want to do anything more complicated than simply executing commands and capturing their output, you'll need to use channels (Net::SSH::Connection::Channel) to build state machines that are executed while the event loop runs (Net::SSH::Connection::Session#loop).
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Net::SSH::Connection::Session and Net::SSH::Connection::Channel have more information about this technique.
