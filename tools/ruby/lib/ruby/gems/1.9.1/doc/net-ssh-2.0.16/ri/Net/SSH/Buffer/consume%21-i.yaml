- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Consumes n bytes from the buffer, where n is the current position unless otherwise specified. This is useful for removing data from the buffer that has previously been read, when you are expecting more data to be appended. It helps to keep the size of buffers down when they would otherwise tend to grow without bound.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Returns the buffer object itself.
