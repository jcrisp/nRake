- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: Registers a callback to be invoked when a channel request of the given type is received. The callback will receive the channel as the first argument, and the associated (unparsed) data as the second. The data will be a Net::SSH::Buffer that you will need to parse, yourself, according to the kind of request you are watching.
- !ruby/struct:RDoc::Markup::Flow::P 
  :body: By default, if the request wants a reply, Net::SSH will send a CHANNEL_SUCCESS response for any request that was handled by a registered callback, and CHANNEL_FAILURE for any that wasn't, but if you want your registered callback to result in a CHANNEL_FAILURE response, just raise Net::SSH::ChannelRequestFailed.

    :label: "*"
    :body: "&quot;exit-signal&quot; : if the remote process died as a result of a signal being sent to it, the signal will be reported as a string in the data, via data.read_string. (Not all SSH servers support this channel request type.)"
